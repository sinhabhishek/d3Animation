In this assignment, I chose a dataset that represents the information of 5 soccer teams. The dataset shows the number of goals 
scored (on y-axis) and fouls conceded (on x-axis) by the 5 teams in 5 soccer games. Each soccer team is represented by a 
circle of different color and these teams are the categories in my dataset. On clicking the “Next” button, one can see the 
goals and fouls of each team in each of the 5 games.

For the modification aspect, I added axes labels so that the viewer can clearly see which metrics are shown across the 2 axes. 
Also, I have modified the starter code in such a way that the size of every circle in the visualization changes dynamically 
based on the number of goals scored by a team in a particular game. Since the result of a game of soccer is determined 
primarily by the number of goals scored, this modification seemed to make sense for the visualization of this dataset.

Also, I have added a bounce animation effect with delay and duration parameters for all circles which adds to the visual 
appeal of the visualization. On clicking the “Next” button, one can see a delay in the movement of all circles which bounce 
and reach the next value (for the next game).

I discussed a few aspects of this assignment with Mudit Kakkar who also helped me in debugging my code on a couple of 
occasions. We discussed possible code modification options which helped me come up with my final visualization. I also 
discussed my doubts with Usman who was kind enough to point me to the right resources for those doubts.
